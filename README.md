```
### Data Preprocessing

Before conducting the analysis, I performed the following data preprocessing steps:

Handling Missing Data: I checked for missing values in the dataset and either removed or imputed them as appropriate.

Data Cleaning: I removed any duplicate records and irrelevant columns that did not contribute to the analysis.

Feature Engineering: I created new features or derived relevant information from existing ones to enhance the analysis.

### Analysis

Analysis Goals

The primary goals of this analysis were:

Customer Insights: To understand customer preferences and behavior, such as their favorite dishes, dining frequency, and peak hours.

Performance Metrics: To assess the performance of restaurants in terms of customer satisfaction and revenue.

Trends and Patterns: To identify any trends or patterns in the data, such as seasonality or popular cuisines.

Methodology

We employed the following methodologies and techniques for our analysis:

Descriptive Statistics: used basic statistical measures to summarize and describe the dataset.

Data Visualization: created various visualizations, including bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps, to represent the data graphically.

### Results

Key Findings

After conducting the analysis, we obtained the following key findings:

Customers tend to prefer Italian cuisine over other types, with pizza being the most ordered dish.

The busiest hours for restaurants are between 6:00 PM and 9:00 PM, with Friday being the busiest day of the week.

Customer satisfaction scores are positively correlated with the average rating of dishes.

Restaurants located in the city center generate higher revenue compared to those in suburban areas.

There is a noticeable increase in customer orders during the holiday season.

These findings provide valuable insights for restaurant owners and can be used to make informed decisions and optimize business operations.
